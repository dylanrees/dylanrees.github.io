About me
======

I am an interdisciplinary electrical engineer currently employed as a Lecturer at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  In my research, I harness bacterial electron transport mechanisms to synthesize semiconductor nanomaterials and create bioelectrochemical sensors under ambient conditions. This biological approach enables many avenues of control over material properties while introducing a simple manufacturing process at room temperature using standard microbiology equipment. My work establishes a new platform for creating electronic devices and sensors that are more sustainable, adaptable, and cost-effective than conventional approaches.

Beyond my technical work, I am interested in using my engineering research as a context for work at the borderline between engineering and the humanities. My non-technical interests include citizen science, STEM education, and social science perspectives on engineering practice. I am an active member of the Society for the Social Studies of Science, where I have participated in panels and workshops and collaborated with researchers in Science and Technology Studies.
