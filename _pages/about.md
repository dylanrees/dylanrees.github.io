About me
======

I am a Lecturer at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. My research combines microbiology with semiconductor, device, sensor, and materials engineering. One of my major research projects focuses on growing dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria under anaerobic conditions, utilizing their "metal-breathing"capabilities to bio-assemble semiconductor nanomaterials. The goal of this work is to explore how these bio-assembly methods can offer advantages in semiconductor device manufacture such as room-temperature synthesis, controllability, novel nanostructures, bio-passivation, and the ability to combine wastewater treatment with electronics manufacturing. I am also interested in studying how biofilms of bacteria and other microorganisms respond to environmental changes at biofilm-electrode interfaces. The goal of studying such interfaces is to engineer biosensors capable of converting microbial processes into electric current, enabling new and versatile methods of environmental sensing. 

Beyond my technical work, I am interested in using my engineering research as a context for work at the borderline between engineering and the humanities. My non-technical interests include citizen science, STEM education, and social science perspectives on engineering practice. I am an active member of the Society for the Social Studies of Science, where I have participated in panels and workshops and collaborated with researchers in Science and Technology Studies.
